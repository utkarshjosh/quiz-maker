Design Prompt: AI-Powered Quizverse – A Social Creative Desk for Quizzes
🧭 Product Vision
Design a smooth, immersive, and playful AI Quiz Experience where people don’t just make and take quizzes — they play with knowledge and shape it socially.

This isn’t a dashboard. It’s not a set of pages.
This is a creative desk powered by AI — where you can:

Create quizzes with a chat

Modify them instantly

Share and host socially

Explore other people’s brains
All within a single, responsive, living space.

Think: Notion AI + Replit Ghostwriter + Pinterest vibes

🖼️ 1. Landing View — Entry to the Quizverse
Goal: Communicate delight and power in a single screen.
Vibe: “Test your brain or train it.” Curiosity meets action.

Structure:
Hero Title:
Test your brain or train it.
Sub: "Quizzes generated in seconds. Explore. Play. Share."

Animated quiz cards floating and rotating behind the CTA.

Actions:
[ Explore Quizzes ]
[ Create Your Own ] → opens immersive chat+form

Top right: Log in / Profile
On login: avatar + tiny dropdown with access to “My Desk”

🧪 2. Explore Mode — The Library with a Pulse
Forget static grid layouts. This is exploration through movement.

Design:
Horizontal carousels for:

🔥 Trending

🆕 Recently Created

🎯 Themed Collections

Each quiz card is collectible:

Topic, Difficulty, Time

Tap = Start

Save 💾 | Share 📤

Minimal filters on top with emoji-tag toggles

🛠️ 3. Create Mode — The Desk Interface
🎯 Core Shift: Not a Page → A Workspace
When you hit “Create,” you’re not on a new page.
You’re now in the Quiz Creation Desk, a dynamic 3-pane space:

👈 Left: The Assistant (Chat)
Ask AI to generate a quiz:

“Make a quiz about Norse mythology for 12-year-olds”

Context-aware replies from AI, but quizzes appear visually, not just as raw text.

🧩 Center: Quiz Cards
Each generated quiz appears inline, visually, editable.
Clicking "Edit" pops in a quick editor drawer on the right.

👉 Right: Context Panel (Slide-In)
Parameters before generation

Editor when modifying

Host settings after finalization

✨ Use soft animation — drawers slide, not jump.

🤖 4. Modify / Regenerate / Host — All in Flow
Every quiz lives inside the creative space.
Actions appear next to each quiz, contextually:

Regenerate quiz 🔁

Modify via prompt ✏️

Edit manually

Click “Finalize” = Trigger Host Setup

Host Setup UI:

Private / Public / Link-share

Time limit / Open access / Invite only

See preview, cover image, category, etc.

📁 5. My Desk – Smart, Soft, Social
Rather than a full page of history, “My Desk” is a lightweight palette:

Accessible via Command-K or avatar dropdown

Floating drawer with:

📜 Quizzes Created

🧠 Quizzes Taken

⭐ Favorites

✨ Drafts

Each opens inline into the current desk, not a new tab.

💬 6. Quiz as Conversation
When AI creates a quiz, it appears as a message bubble with:

Quiz preview

Action buttons

Follow-up suggestions like “Make it harder”, “Add fun facts”

Let the quiz generation feel like a collaborative art.

🌈 7. Visual & UX Style
Element	Style
Fonts	Inter, Nunito — friendly and smart
Colors	Indigo → Soft Sky Blue, with Coral or Lemon accents
Backgrounds	Subtle paper white or dark navy (soft gradients allowed)
Cards	Tactile, rounded, slightly lifted — glow on hover
Animation	Slide, fade, pop-in — never abrupt
Interactions	Sparkles, micro confetti, pulsing buttons, floating actions

Inspirations:
Notion AI (center-focused, flexible spaces)

Linear (smart drawers)

Duolingo (delightful gamification)

Pinterest (fluid card structure)

🧭 Navigation Logic
Minimal visible structure. Only show what’s needed.

Action	How it's exposed
Create quiz	Floating button → opens creation desk
View old quiz	Command-K / Desk palette → opens inline
Host	Appears only after finalization
Edit quiz	Button on quiz card → drawer

🧠 Final Thought (To Guide Design)
“Let users feel like they’re co-creating with magic.”

The interface should fade away and let curiosity drive the flow.
Fun, helpful, never overwhelming. This is the most human AI app — social, creative, and joyful.
