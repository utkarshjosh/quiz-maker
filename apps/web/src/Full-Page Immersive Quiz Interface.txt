Full-Page Immersive Quiz Interface
We recommend reworking the quiz into a full-screen, responsive layout with a clean, playful theme. Use
Tailwind/DaisyUI for  rapid styling and TanStack Query for  data.  Define a soft  pastel  palette (as in your
index.css :  light purples, blues, teals, yellows) on a neutral background to keep the look  minimal but

playful.  DaisyUI’s  semantic  color  classes  ( primary ,  secondary ,  accent ,  etc.)  let  you  apply  these
custom hues consistently. For example, set --primary  to a vivid lavender and --secondary  to a gentle
teal (see Colors section below). DaisyUI even uses CSS variables under the hood to support easy theming
(dark mode, etc.) without extra work 1 . 

• Tailwind Layout: Wrap the app in a full-viewport container ( <div class="flex h-screen 
items-center justify-center"> ) so the quiz fills the page. Center the question card in this
container. Tailwind’s utility classes (like rounded-lg , shadow-md , p-8 , etc.) make it easy to style
a card: apply a subtle drop-shadow and generous padding so the quiz panel “pops” off the
background 2 . 

• DaisyUI Components: Use DaisyUI’s prebuilt components (cards, buttons, stats, progress bars) as
building blocks. For instance, a DaisyUI <div class="card bg-white text-foreground">  can
hold a question and multiple-choice answers. Its rounded  and shadow  modifiers add polish with
minimal code. Similarly, DaisyUI’s progress or stats components can display score or streak
information in a clear, themed way. 

Center each question on a card with ample white space. Tailwind’s flex/grid utilities ensure the quiz container
spans the full height and width. As one example, a PureCode design uses a sleek responsive card with pastel
accents and smooth spacing 3 2 .

Color Scheme & Theme
Maintain a  light neutral background (e.g. Tailwind’s  bg-base-100  or a custom light gray) so colored
accents stand out. Then use your custom CSS variables (from index.css ) for accent colors: e.g.
- Primary (Lavender) – use bg-primary  or text-primary  (set to hsl(265,70%,60%)  per your CSS)
for main buttons and highlights.
- Secondary (Teal) – use bg-secondary / text-secondary  (e.g. a soft teal) for secondary actions.
- Accent (Light Blue) – use bg-accent  for decorative elements or badges. 

Set card backgrounds to white ( --card: 0 0% 100% )  with dark text for readability.  Ensure sufficient
contrast:  DaisyUI’s  color  system  (with  semantic  content colors)  handles  dark/light  text  on  colored
backgrounds automatically. For example, DaisyUI notes that its color names yield dark mode and theme
support  “with  zero  effort” 1 .  In  practice,  this  means  you  can  use
<button class="btn btn-primary">  or <span class="badge badge-secondary">  and DaisyUI

will apply your chosen colors. 

• Playful Accents: Sprinkle in your custom “quiz” colors (lavender, baby blue, teal, soft yellow) in small
doses – e.g. as icon backgrounds, progress bars, or badges – to keep the UI lively. The Nixtio
leaderboard mockup (below) shows pastel confetti and bright avatars on a dark panel; a similar
approach (subtle pastel decorations on a neutral card) conveys fun without clutter 4 . 

• Dark Mode (if used): With DaisyUI and CSS variables, dark mode toggling comes for free. Your CSS
already sets dark-theme HSL values under .dark . Just add a toggle (or rely on next-themes ) to
switch classes. 

Animations & Interactivity
Animations make the quiz  feel  alive.  Use Tailwind’s  animation utilities  (or  the  tailwindcss-animate
plugin) for smooth effects on hover and state changes. For example, add classes like hover:scale-105 
transition duration-200  to answer buttons so they gently enlarge on hover. Keyframe animations can
celebrate correct answers: a small  confetti burst or a green checkmark that  pops into view gives instant
feedback. (For instance, animate confetti falling from the top when an answer is correct 5 .) Conversely, a
wrong answer could trigger a quick shake or red highlight effect. Tailwind’s animate-pulse , animate-
bounce , and animate-shake  (or custom keyframes) can implement these. 

• Hover/Click Effects: Apply Tailwind’s hover:  and focus:  classes (scale, color shift, shadow) to
cards and buttons for subtle feedback. Even DaisyUI’s buttons ( btn ) support states like btn-
success / btn-error  on answer selection. 

• Question Transitions: Fade or slide the quiz card between questions. Using React Transition Group
or a library like Framer Motion (alongside Tailwind utilities) can create a seamless page change effect

6 . For instance, fade out the old question card and fade in the new one. 
• Progress/Score Animations: Animate the progress bar fill with transition-all  so it advances

smoothly. When revealing the final score, use a combination of scale-up  and fade-in
(Tailwind’s transform  + opacity  classes) for a celebratory effect 7 . 

• Confetti and Celebrations: On a correct answer or quiz completion, trigger a brief confetti
animation or a badge bounce. The design prompt suggests “confetti falling from the top” on success

5  – you can implement this with a small JS animation or CSS @keyframes. These playful touches
make the quiz rewarding. 

Real-Time Leaderboard & Gamification
Display an active leaderboard alongside or after the quiz. Use TanStack Query to fetch and cache scores in
real time. For example, query a /leaderboard  endpoint and set a refetch interval or use WebSockets to
push updates. React Query’s cache can then update the UI automatically. As one guide notes, TanStack
Query  “simplifies  data  fetching”  and  provides  automatic  caching  and  efficient  data  management,
making  real-time  updates  seamless 8 .  In  practice,  on  receiving  a  new  score  you  can  use
queryClient.setQueryData  to optimistically update the leaderboard before the server confirms. This

makes the UI feel instant. 

Show the leaderboard with a prominent top scorer. This example uses a dark card and pastel confetti to highlight
first place, with other entries listed below. Note how the winner’s avatar and “100% completed” badge draw the
eye.  Gamified leaderboards  like  this  (with  vibrant  avatars  and pastel  confetti)  are  shown to  be  “playful  and
engaging” and make progress feel rewarding 4 .

• Leaderboard UI: Format each entry as a card or row: avatar, name, score/progress. Use DaisyUI’s
card or stats components for consistency. Highlight the top place (e.g. with a crown icon or glowing
badge) and use subtle hover lifting on each entry ( hover:shadow-lg ) for interactivity. 

• Live Updates: With TanStack Query, enable either polling ( refetchInterval ) or use a WebSocket
subscription. The GophersLab example shows subscribing to a WebSocket and calling 
queryClient.setQueryData  on new data 8 . This way, when players answer questions, the

leaderboard reflects it instantly. 
• Gamification Badges: Award on-screen badges or points for milestones (e.g. “5 Correct in a Row”).

Use DaisyUI’s badge  component (e.g. <div class="badge badge-success"> ) and animate
them subtly (e.g. a quick bounce ) when earned.

Responsive Design
Ensure the interface is  mobile-friendly.  Tailwind is  mobile-first  by default.  Use responsive utilities  (e.g.
sm: ,  md: )  to adjust layout on smaller screens. For instance, stack elements ( flex-col )  on narrow

viewports and use grid columns ( md:grid-cols-2 ) on wide screens. All text should use relative units (e.g.
text-xl  or larger for questions) so it scales. The design prompt emphasizes that  “all animations, hover

effects, and transformations are mobile responsive” 9  – so avoid tiny click targets and test on phone. 

• Layout Adjustments: On small screens, switch from a side-by-side layout to a single column. For
example, if your desktop quiz and sidebar (leaderboard) are side by side, use flex-col-reverse 
md:flex-row  so the quiz appears first on mobile. 

• Touch Targets: Make buttons and answers large enough ( px-4 py-2 , min-h-[40px] ) for finger
taps. Keep margins to prevent mis-taps. 

• Background & Images: Use CSS background properties (as in index.css ) that tile or scale. The
SVG pattern in your body style (lines 93–98) repeats nicely on any size. For any illustrative images,
ensure they are set to max-w-full h-auto . 

• Test and Iterate: Preview on different devices. DaisyUI components are generally responsive out of
the box, but always verify the spacing and font sizes feel right on phones and tablets. 

Summary of Recommendations
• Full-Screen Layout: Use a full-viewport container to center the quiz card (with Tailwind’s h-
screen , flex , etc.) and add a subtle background. Tailwind’s utility-first approach makes creating
polished, responsive layouts straightforward 2 . 

• Clean, Playful Style: Keep the main canvas neutral (light gray/white) with pops of pastel color for
accents (as defined in your CSS variables). Use DaisyUI’s semantic color classes to apply these
consistently 1 . For example, make answer buttons lavender or aqua to stand out against a white
card. 

• Engaging Animations: Animate interactions – e.g. scale up buttons on hover, animate a progress
bar fill, celebrate correct answers with confetti or a bounce 5 . Smooth transitions between quiz
screens (using CSS or React animation libraries) will make the experience feel seamless 6 . 

• Real-Time & Gamification: Display a dynamic leaderboard using TanStack Query. React Query’s
automatic caching and refetching “streamlines the process of working with REST APIs” and supports
real-time updates 8 . Highlight top scores with badges or trophies and use visual rewards (points,
streak badges) to motivate users. The example leaderboard UI above uses vibrant avatars, badges,
and confetti to create a fun, competitive feel 4 . 

• Responsiveness: Ensure the UI scales to all devices. Tailwind’s breakpoints and flex/grid layouts
should rearrange content for phones. As one guide stresses, every animation and component must
be usable on mobile 9 . 

By combining DaisyUI’s component classes with Tailwind’s utility styling (and leveraging TanStack Query for
live data), you can create an immersive, full-page quiz experience. The result will be a sleek, user-friendly
interface – minimal in layout, yet playful with color and animation – that adapts to any screen size and
keeps users engaged 3 2 .
